These are some of the things that I change when doing new forms. 
Look at previous forms I've created to notice. 
This is so that we dont get other forms created differently that might confuse others in the forms.

Name
BackColor
ControlBox
Cursor
FormBorderStyle
KeyPreview
Size
StartPosition
Text


THIS IS THE FINAL VERSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
